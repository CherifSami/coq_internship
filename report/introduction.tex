\chapter{Introduction}

As a part of my Bachelor studies in computer science at the university of Lille 1, I did a 12-week internship at the Research Center in Computer Science, Signal and Automatic Control of Lille (CRIStAL). This internship revolves around the PIP pretokernel and its deep embedding currently being developed by the 2XS team. PIP is a minimal OS kernel with provable memory isolation using Hoare logic. The deep embedding of PIP (DEC), as opposed to the shallow embedding, is an intermediate language for the translation of PIP to C.  \\

The main objective of the internship is to replicate shallow proofs in the deep embedding to ascertain their feasibility and compare the differences between them. This requires modelling PIP functions in the deep embedding.  a modular
