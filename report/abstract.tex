Formal proofs on program correctness are becoming longer and more complex especially when dealing with critical software. Therefore, it is essential to make these proofs as structured as possible, legible and amendable. The purpose of this research is to check whether the strict structuring of DEC, an intermediate deeply embedded language for the translation of the PIP protokernel to C, is reflected in invariant proofs and to compare them to those in the shallow embedding. To that end, three distinct invariants in the shallow embedding were replicated in DEC. Their program functions were modelled modularly and the invariant proofs were done correspondingly. \\
