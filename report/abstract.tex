Formal proofs on program correctness are becoming longer and more complex especially when dealing with critical software. Therefore, it is essential to make these proofs as structured as possible, legible and amendable. The purpose of this research is to study proofs specified in DEC, an intermediate deeply embedded language for the translation of the PIP protokernel, a minimal OS kernel with provable isolation, to C. We specifically want to check whether the strict structuring of DEC is reflected in invariant proofs and to compare them to those in the shallow embedding in which PIP is specified. To that end, three distinct invariants in the shallow embedding were replicated in DEC. Their program functions were modelled modularly and the invariant proofs were done correspondingly. \\
